# QCMachineLearning
In this project, I use classification machine learning tools to assess the sufficiency of metagenomic samples.
I also work with analyzing the results of the classifiers, comparing against different classifiers, and data intake, normalization, and preprocessing.
The code is executed through the main.py file, with python scripts for data intake / normalization, scripts for running the classifiers, and scripts for assessing the results of different classifiers.
