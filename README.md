# QCMachineLearning
In this project, I use classification machine learning tools to assess the sufficiency of metagenomic samples.
I also work with analyzing the results of the classifiers, comparing against different classifiers, and data intake along with data normalization and preprocessing.
The code is executed through the main.py file, with python scripts for data intake / normalization, scripts for running the classifiers, and scripts for assessing the results of different classifiers. Sample classification can be seperately executed through the results.py file for novel sample classification. 
Attached as images are a Precision vs. Recall Curve for the primary tweaked classifier and the average precision score for the best used classifier.
